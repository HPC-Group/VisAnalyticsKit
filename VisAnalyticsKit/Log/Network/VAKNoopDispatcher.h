/**
 *  The noop dispatcher is a standin for an actual dispatcher, that
 *  actually does some work. This dispatcher is to be used with the various 
 *  types of console providers that don't have a real endpoint.
 *  It's a singleton to be easy on system resources like RAM, also there is no need 
 *  in having multiple instances of a noop anything.
